## Important Disclaimers

### Data Quality and Limitations
- This dataset contains **raw, unprocessed sensor readings** and has not undergone comprehensive quality assurance procedures
- The custom-built Sensirion SEN55 sensors (Numbers 2 and 7) may exhibit different calibration characteristics compared to commercial equivalents
- Two different laboratory environments were used for data collection, which may introduce environmental variability
- Data gaps, anomalies, or measurement uncertainties may be present and have not been systematically identified or corrected

### Intended Use
- Commercial use requires explicit written permission from NYU Abu Dhabi and SMART Lab


### Acknowledgment
Data collected at New York University Abu Dhabi by the SMART Lab. Users of this dataset should acknowledge the source institution, SMART Lab. For questions about data collection methodology, sensor specifications, or technical details, please contact: smart.nyuad@gmail.com
