# Data Disclaimer - Laboratory Sensor Readings

**Data Collection Period:** June 1, 2025 05:00 - June 4, 2025 09:00 (UAE Standard Time)  
**Location:** Laboratory Environment, NYU Abu Dhabi Campus

## Data Sources
- **Atmocube Sensor:** Commercial environmental monitoring device
- **Custom Sensirion SPS55 Sensor:** Laboratory-built particulate matter sensor

## Important Disclaimers

### Data Quality and Limitations
- This dataset contains **raw, unprocessed sensor readings** and has not undergone quality assurance procedures
- The custom-built Sensirion SPS55 sensor may have different calibration characteristics compared to commercial equivalents
- Sensor accuracy may be affected by laboratory environmental conditions, electromagnetic interference, or other local factors
- Data gaps, anomalies, or measurement uncertainties may be present and have not been systematically identified or corrected
- Cross-validation between sensors has not been performed

### Intended Use
- Data is provided for **research and educational purposes only**
- Users must independently validate data quality and suitability for their specific applications
- Not intended for regulatory compliance, health assessments, or critical decision-making without proper validation
- Commercial use requires explicit permission from NYU Abu Dhabi

### Technical Considerations
- Atmocube sensor operates according to manufacturer specifications
- Custom Sensirion SPS55 sensor performance characteristics may differ from standard implementations
- Environmental factors within the laboratory setting may influence readings
- Sensor placement, ventilation, and local activities may affect measurements

### Liability and Responsibility
- NYU Abu Dhabi and the research team provide this data "as is" without warranties of any kind
- Users assume full responsibility for data validation and appropriate use
- The institution and researchers are not liable for decisions made based on this dataset
- Independent verification is strongly recommended before drawing conclusions

### Acknowledgment
Data collected at New York University Abu Dhabi. Users of this dataset should acknowledge the source institution and research team in any publications or presentations.
